The codes correspond to Fig. 12 in [Ref]. One can change the parameters in line 7 and line 8 of the .m file entitled "main_..." for different settings.

IRS_type (in line 7):
	'C': continuous metasurfaces;
	'U': ultra-dense RIS with element spacing d < lambda/2;
	'D': critical-spacing RIS with d = lambda/2;

DSC_type (in line 8, also see Fig. 8 in [Ref]):
	'R': DSC random allocation;
	'B': DSC block allocation;
	'U': DSC uniform allocation;
